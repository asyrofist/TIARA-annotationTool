I agree with the previous statement.
If somebody smokes in the restaurant, other people may not be able to enjoy the experience.
At restaurants, customers enjoy eating and talking.
However, if we ban smoking in restaurants, then those restaurants might lose some customers.
Some restaurants are indeed popular, especially among old men, because they allow people to smoke.
But, I firmly support banning smoking in restaurants because we need to prioritise health.
In conclusion, I encourage banning smoking in all restaurants.
