	Error: when we establish relation, there is a dialogue to choose the relation label. When the annotators press "esc", the dialogue will be closed and there is no relation assigned! --> marked as "temporary" by jsplumb

	Solution: resolved by preventing close on escape; "js/annotation_v3.js", function relationDialog(conn)

	unused variable in isFullAnnotation(numberOfSentences); numberOfSentences -> unused

	Even though the "temporary" label has been patched in 01/17, the problem still exists. Better to add an additional checking functionality before saving the file.
